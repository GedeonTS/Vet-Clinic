# curriculum-databases-projects-template

In this project, I used a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. I created a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, queried and updated animals table using transactions as well as using GROUP BY syntax when querying aggregate data using SQL aggregate functions like AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT e.t.c. I Used primary key & foreign key mechanism for joining tables, Queried multiple tables and prepared complex queries that answered analytical questions. Additionally I implemented many-to-many relation between relations.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
